# Sandbox, Tools, MCP, Skills

Split out of `backend/CLAUDE.md` (source of truth for agent runtime architecture).

## Sandbox System (`packages/harness/deerflow/sandbox/`)

**Interface**: Abstract `Sandbox` with `execute_command`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_dir`
**Provider Pattern**: `SandboxProvider` with `acquire`, `acquire_async`, `get`, `release` lifecycle. Async agent/tool paths call async sandbox lifecycle hooks so Docker sandbox creation, discovery, cross-process locking, readiness polling, and release stay off the event loop.
**Implementations**:
- `LocalSandboxProvider` - Local filesystem execution. `acquire(thread_id)` returns a per-thread `LocalSandbox` (id `local:{thread_id}`) whose `path_mappings` resolve `/mnt/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}` and `/mnt/acp-workspace` to that thread's host directories, so the public `Sandbox` API honours the `/mnt/user-data` contract uniformly with AIO. `acquire()` / `acquire(None)` keeps the legacy generic singleton (id `local`) for callers without a thread context. Per-thread sandboxes are held in an LRU cache (default 256 entries) guarded by a `threading.Lock`.
- `AioSandboxProvider` (`packages/harness/deerflow/community/`) - Docker-based isolation. Active-cache and warm-pool entries are checked with the backend during acquire/reuse; definitively dead containers are dropped from all in-process maps so the thread can discover or create a fresh sandbox instead of reusing a stale client. Backend health-check failures are treated as unknown, not dead; local discovery likewise treats an unverifiable container as not adoptable and falls through to create rather than failing acquire. `get()` remains an in-memory lookup for event-loop-safe tool paths.

**Virtual Path System**:
- Agent sees: `/mnt/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}`, `/mnt/skills`
- Physical: `backend/.deer-flow/users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/...`, `deer-flow/skills/`
- Translation: `LocalSandboxProvider` builds per-thread `PathMapping`s for the user-data prefixes at acquire time; `tools.py` keeps `replace_virtual_path()` / `replace_virtual_paths_in_command()` as a defense-in-depth layer (and for path validation). AIO has the directories volume-mounted at the same virtual paths inside its container, so both implementations accept `/mnt/user-data/...` natively.
- Detection: `is_local_sandbox()` accepts both `sandbox_id == "local"` (legacy / no-thread) and `sandbox_id.startswith("local:")` (per-thread)

**Sandbox Tools** (in `packages/harness/deerflow/sandbox/tools.py`):
- `bash` - Execute commands with path translation and error handling. For `LocalSandbox` (host bash), POSIX output is captured through bounded pipe-drain threads and stdin is `/dev/null`, so a backgrounded long-lived process (`server &`) returns immediately instead of blocking the turn on an inherited pipe, while unredirected background output is drained without growing anonymous temp files. Commands that read stdin get immediate EOF. The command runs in its own process group with a wall-clock timeout (`sandbox.bash_command_timeout`, default 600s); on timeout the whole group is killed and the agent gets a notice telling it to background long-lived processes. The bash tool description itself also instructs the model to background long-lived processes (e.g. servers) up front so it doesn't waste the turn waiting on a foreground server. See `LocalSandbox.execute_command` / `_run_posix_command` and `bash_tool`'s docstring.
- `ls` - Directory listing (tree format, max 2 levels)
- `read_file` - Read file contents with optional line range
- `write_file` - Write/append to files, creates directories; overwrites by default and exposes the `append` argument in the model-facing schema for end-of-file writes
- `str_replace` - Substring replacement (single or all occurrences); same-path serialization is scoped to `(sandbox.id, path)` so isolated sandboxes do not contend on identical virtual paths inside one process

## Tool System (`packages/harness/deerflow/tools/`)

`get_available_tools(groups, include_mcp, model_name, subagent_enabled)` assembles:
1. **Config-defined tools** - Resolved from `config.yaml` via `resolve_variable()`
2. **MCP tools** - From enabled MCP servers (lazy initialized, cached with mtime invalidation)
3. **Built-in tools**:
   - `present_files` - Make output files visible to user (only `/mnt/user-data/outputs`)
   - `ask_clarification` - Request clarification (intercepted by ClarificationMiddleware → interrupts)
   - `view_image` - Read image as base64 (added only if model supports vision)
   - `setup_agent` - Bootstrap-only: persist a brand-new custom agent's `SOUL.md` and `config.yaml`. Bound only when `is_bootstrap=True`.
   - `update_agent` - Custom-agent-only: persist self-updates to the current agent's `SOUL.md` / `config.yaml` from inside a normal chat (partial update + atomic write). Bound when `agent_name` is set and `is_bootstrap=False`.
4. **Subagent tool** (if enabled):
   - `task` - Delegate to subagent (description, prompt, subagent_type)

**Community tools** (`packages/harness/deerflow/community/`): optional integrations, each in its own subpackage and wired through `config.yaml`. Documented examples:
- `tavily/` - Web search (5 results default) and web fetch (4KB limit)
- `jina_ai/` - Web fetch via Jina reader API with readability extraction
- `firecrawl/` - Web scraping via Firecrawl API
- `image_search/` - Image search
- `aio_sandbox/` - Docker-based isolation (`AioSandboxProvider`)

Additional providers also live here (`brave`, `browserless`, `ddg_search`, `exa`, `fastcrw`, `groundroute`, `infoquest`, `searxng`, `serper`); see each subpackage for specifics.

**ACP agent tools**:
- `invoke_acp_agent` - Invokes external ACP-compatible agents from `config.yaml`
- ACP launchers must be real ACP adapters. The standard `codex` CLI is not ACP-compatible by itself; configure a wrapper such as `npx -y @zed-industries/codex-acp` or an installed `codex-acp` binary
- Missing ACP executables now return an actionable error message instead of a raw `[Errno 2]`
- Each ACP agent uses a per-thread workspace at `{base_dir}/users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/acp-workspace/`. The workspace is accessible to the lead agent via the virtual path `/mnt/acp-workspace/` (read-only). In docker sandbox mode, the directory is volume-mounted into the container at `/mnt/acp-workspace` (read-only); in local sandbox mode, path translation is handled by `tools.py`
- `image_search/` - Image search via DuckDuckGo

## MCP System (`packages/harness/deerflow/mcp/`)

- Uses `langchain-mcp-adapters` `MultiServerMCPClient` for multi-server management
- **Lazy initialization**: Tools loaded on first use via `get_cached_mcp_tools()`
- **Cache invalidation**: Detects config file changes via mtime comparison
- **Transports**: stdio (command-based), SSE, HTTP
- **OAuth (HTTP/SSE)**: Supports token endpoint flows (`client_credentials`, `refresh_token`) with automatic token refresh + Authorization header injection
- **Stdio file outputs**: Persistent stdio sessions are scoped by `user_id:thread_id`. For stdio transports only, DeerFlow pins the subprocess default `cwd` to the thread workspace and `TMPDIR`/`TMP`/`TEMP` to `workspace/.mcp/tmp/`, unless the operator explicitly configured `cwd` or temp env values. SSE/HTTP transports skip this filesystem prep entirely.
- **Stdio path translation**: MCP-returned local file references are not copied. If a `ResourceLink` or conservative free-text path resolves to an existing file inside the thread's mounted user-data tree, it is translated deterministically to `/mnt/user-data/...`; paths outside that tree remain unchanged.
- **Runtime updates**: Gateway API saves to extensions_config.json; the Gateway-embedded runtime detects changes via mtime

## Skills System (`packages/harness/deerflow/skills/`)

- **Location**: `deer-flow/skills/{public,custom}/`
- **Format**: Directory with `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter: name, description, license, allowed-tools)
- **Loading**: `load_skills()` recursively scans `skills/{public,custom}` for `SKILL.md`, parses metadata, and reads enabled state from extensions_config.json
- **Injection**: Enabled skills listed in agent system prompt with container paths
- **Slash activation**: `/skill-name task` loads that enabled skill's `SKILL.md` for the current model call only. The resolver rejects leading whitespace, missing separators, reserved channel commands (`/new`, `/help`, `/bootstrap`, `/status`, `/models`, `/memory`), disabled skills, and skills outside a custom agent's whitelist.
- **Installation**: `POST /api/skills/install` extracts .skill ZIP archive to custom/ directory
