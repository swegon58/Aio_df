# IM Channels System (`app/channels/`)

Split out of `backend/CLAUDE.md` (source of truth for agent runtime architecture).

Bridges external messaging platforms (Feishu, Slack, Telegram, Discord, DingTalk) to the DeerFlow agent via Gateway's LangGraph-compatible API.

**Architecture**: Channels communicate with Gateway through the `langgraph-sdk` HTTP client (same as the frontend), ensuring threads are created and managed server-side. The internal SDK client injects process-local internal auth plus a matching CSRF cookie/header pair so Gateway accepts state-changing thread/run requests from channel workers without relying on browser session cookies.

**Components**:
- `message_bus.py` - Async pub/sub hub (`InboundMessage` → queue → dispatcher; `OutboundMessage` → callbacks → channels)
- `store.py` - JSON-file persistence mapping `channel_name:chat_id[:topic_id]` → `thread_id` (keys are `channel:chat` for root conversations and `channel:chat:topic` for threaded conversations)
- `manager.py` - Core dispatcher: creates threads via `client.threads.create()`, routes commands, keeps Slack/Discord on `client.runs.wait()`, and uses `client.runs.stream(["messages-tuple", "values"])` for Feishu/Telegram incremental outbound updates
- `base.py` - Abstract `Channel` base class (start/stop/send lifecycle)
- `service.py` - Manages lifecycle of all configured channels from `config.yaml`
- `slack.py` / `feishu.py` / `telegram.py` / `discord.py` / `dingtalk.py` - Platform-specific implementations (`feishu.py` tracks the running card `message_id` in memory and patches the same card in place; `telegram.py` registers the "Working on it..." placeholder as the stream target and edits it in place via `editMessageText`; `dingtalk.py` optionally uses AI Card streaming for in-place updates when `card_template_id` is configured)
- `app/gateway/routers/channel_connections.py` - Browser-facing user connection and disconnect APIs
- `deerflow.persistence.channel_connections` - SQL-backed user-owned connection, optional credential, connect state, and conversation store

**Message Flow**:
1. External platform -> Channel impl -> `MessageBus.publish_inbound()`
2. `ChannelManager._dispatch_loop()` consumes from queue
3. For user-owned channel connections, incoming messages carry `connection_id`, `owner_user_id`, and `workspace_id`; `owner_user_id` becomes the DeerFlow run `user_id`, while the raw platform user id remains `channel_user_id`
4. For chat: look up/create thread through Gateway's LangGraph-compatible API
5. Feishu/Telegram chat: `runs.stream()` → accumulate AI text → publish multiple outbound updates (`is_final=False`) → publish final outbound (`is_final=True`)
6. Slack/Discord chat: `runs.wait()` → extract final response → publish outbound
7. Feishu channel sends one running reply card up front, then patches the same card for each outbound update (card JSON sets `config.update_multi=true` for Feishu's patch API requirement)
8. Telegram streaming: the "Working on it..." placeholder message is registered as the stream target; non-final updates `editMessageText` it in place (channel-side throttle: 1s in private chats, 3s in groups due to Telegram's 20 msg/min group cap; 4096-char truncation; rate-limited updates dropped); the final update performs the last edit and splits >4096 texts into follow-up messages
9. DingTalk AI Card mode (when `card_template_id` configured): `runs.stream()` → create card with initial text → stream updates via `PUT /v1.0/card/streaming` → finalize on `is_final=True`. Falls back to `sampleMarkdown` if card creation or streaming fails
10. For commands (`/new`, `/status`, `/models`, `/memory`, `/help`): handle locally or query Gateway API
11. Outbound → channel callbacks → platform reply

**Owner-scoped file storage**: inbound files, uploads, and output artifacts are staged under the DeerFlow owner's bucket so they land where the agent run reads/writes (`users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/{uploads,outputs}`). `ChannelManager._handle_chat` resolves the storage owner once via `_channel_storage_user_id(msg)` (sanitized owner id, falling back to `safe(msg.user_id)` for unbound auth-enabled channels — mirroring `_resolve_run_params`'s run identity; `None` only when no identity is available) and threads it as the `user_id=` kwarg through the file pipeline:
- `Channel.receive_file(msg, thread_id, user_id=...)` — owner-bound channels persist downloaded files under the owner's bucket instead of the default bucket
- `_ingest_inbound_files(...)` and the underlying `ensure_uploads_dir` / `get_uploads_dir` — owner-scoped via the same kwarg
- `_resolve_attachments` / `_prepare_artifact_delivery` — resolve output artifacts from the bound owner's bucket
The cached value is reused for both the blocking (`runs.wait`) and streaming (`_handle_streaming_chat`) paths, so uploads and artifact delivery always target the same bucket even if a channel returns a rewritten `InboundMessage` from `receive_file`. The bucket id matches the memory bucket resolved by `_resolve_memory_user_id` (both normalize through `make_safe_user_id`).

**Configuration** (`config.yaml` -> `channels`):
- `langgraph_url` - LangGraph-compatible Gateway API base URL (default: `http://localhost:8001/api`)
- `gateway_url` - Gateway API URL for auxiliary commands (default: `http://localhost:8001`)
- In Docker Compose, IM channels run inside the `gateway` container, so `localhost` points back to that container. Use `http://gateway:8001/api` for `langgraph_url` and `http://gateway:8001` for `gateway_url`, or set `DEER_FLOW_CHANNELS_LANGGRAPH_URL` / `DEER_FLOW_CHANNELS_GATEWAY_URL`.
- Per-channel configs: `feishu` (app_id, app_secret), `slack` (bot_token, app_token), `telegram` (bot_token), `dingtalk` (client_id, client_secret, optional `card_template_id` for AI Card streaming)

**User-owned channel connections** (`config.yaml` -> `channel_connections`):
- Disabled by default. It is a user-binding layer on top of the existing `channels.*` runtime config, not a replacement for provider bot credentials.
- No public IP, OAuth callback URL, or provider webhook route is required by the current implementation.
- Telegram uses a deep-link `/start <code>` flow over the existing long-polling worker. Slack, Discord, Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, WeChat, and WeCom use `/connect <code>` over their existing outbound channel workers.
- Frontend APIs: `GET /api/channels/providers`, `GET /api/channels/connections`, `POST /api/channels/{provider}/connect`, and `DELETE /api/channels/connections/{connection_id}`.
- Browser APIs remain protected by normal Gateway auth/CSRF. Provider messages arrive through the already-configured channel workers.
- Provider-level `connection_status` reflects the user's newest connection row. With no binding it is `not_connected`, except in auth-disabled local mode where a configured running channel reports `connected` because all channel messages already route to the default user.
- Slack replies use the configured operator bot token from `channels.slack` unless per-connection credentials are present; unreadable or corrupt stored credentials are treated as unavailable.
- Telegram, Slack, Discord, Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, WeChat, and WeCom workers resolve incoming platform identities to connection records before reaching `ChannelManager`.
- **Connect-code ordering vs `allowed_users`**: inbound workers consume a valid `/connect <code>` (or Telegram `/start <code>`) **before** applying the `allowed_users` filter, so a newly allowlisted-but-unbound user can bootstrap their first bind via the browser flow. Consequence: `allowed_users` is **not** a bind-time defense — any sender who possesses a valid code can consume it (not only allowlisted users). The bind security model rests on the code's confidentiality: `secrets.token_urlsafe(16)`, 600 s TTL, one-time `consume_oauth_state`, and codes surfaced only in the initiating browser (never echoed to chat). `allowed_users` still gates ordinary (non-bind) messages.
- **Single-active-owner transfer semantics**: an external identity is keyed by `(provider, external_account_id, workspace_id)`. The latest successful bind wins — `upsert_connection` revokes other owners' active rows for the same identity (ownership transfer). This invariant is enforced at the DB layer by the partial unique index `uq_channel_connection_active_identity` (`WHERE status != 'revoked'`), so concurrent connects from different owners cannot both end `connected`; the losing writer retries against the now-visible state. `find_connection_by_external_identity` therefore resolves deterministically.
