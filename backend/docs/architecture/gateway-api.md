# Gateway API (`app/gateway/`)

Split out of `backend/CLAUDE.md` (source of truth for agent runtime architecture).

FastAPI application on port 8001 with health check at `GET /health`. Set `GATEWAY_ENABLE_DOCS=false` to disable `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` in production (default: enabled).

CORS is same-origin by default when requests enter through nginx on port 2026. Split-origin or port-forwarded browser clients must opt in with `GATEWAY_CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated exact origins); Gateway `CORSMiddleware` and `CSRFMiddleware` both read that variable so browser CORS and auth-origin checks stay aligned.

## Routers

| Router | Endpoints |
|--------|-----------|
| **Models** (`/api/models`) | `GET /` - list models; `GET /{name}` - model details |
| **MCP** (`/api/mcp`) | `GET /config` - get config; `PUT /config` - update config (saves to extensions_config.json) |
| **Skills** (`/api/skills`) | `GET /` - list skills; `GET /{name}` - details; `PUT /{name}` - update enabled; `POST /install` - install from .skill archive (accepts standard optional frontmatter like `version`, `author`, `compatibility`) |
| **Memory** (`/api/memory`) | `GET /` - memory data; `POST /reload` - force reload; `GET /config` - config; `GET /status` - config + data |
| **Uploads** (`/api/threads/{id}/uploads`) | `POST /` - upload files (auto-converts PDF/PPT/Excel/Word); `GET /list` - list; `DELETE /{filename}` - delete |
| **Threads** (`/api/threads/{id}`) | `DELETE /` - remove DeerFlow-managed local thread data after LangGraph thread deletion; unexpected failures are logged server-side and return a generic 500 detail |
| **Artifacts** (`/api/threads/{id}/artifacts`) | `GET /{path}` - serve artifacts; active content types (`text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `image/svg+xml`) are always forced as download attachments to reduce XSS risk; `?download=true` still forces download for other file types |
| **Suggestions** (`/api/suggestions`) | `GET /config` - returns global suggestions config boolean; `POST /threads/{id}/suggestions` - generate follow-up questions; rich list/block model content is normalized and inline reasoning (`<think>...</think>`, including unclosed/truncated blocks from reasoning models like MiniMax-M3) is stripped before JSON parsing |
| **Thread Runs** (`/api/threads/{id}/runs`) | `POST /` - create background run; `POST /stream` - create + SSE stream; `POST /wait` - create + block; `POST /regenerate/prepare` - prepare clean input + checkpoint metadata for regenerating the latest assistant answer; `GET /` - list runs; `GET /{rid}` - run details; `POST /{rid}/cancel` - cancel; `GET /{rid}/join` - join SSE; `GET /{rid}/messages` - paginated messages `{data, has_more}`; `GET /{rid}/events` - full event stream; `GET /../messages` - thread messages with feedback; `GET /../token-usage` - aggregate tokens |
| **Feedback** (`/api/threads/{id}/runs/{rid}/feedback`) | `PUT /` - upsert feedback; `DELETE /` - delete user feedback; `POST /` - create feedback; `GET /` - list feedback; `GET /stats` - aggregate stats; `DELETE /{fid}` - delete specific |
| **Runs** (`/api/runs`) | `POST /stream` - stateless run + SSE; `POST /wait` - stateless run + block; `GET /{rid}/messages` - paginated messages by run_id `{data, has_more}` (cursor: `after_seq`/`before_seq`); `GET /{rid}/feedback` - list feedback by run_id |

## RunManager / RunStore contract

- `RunManager.get()` is async; direct callers must `await` it.
- When a persistent `RunStore` is configured, `get()` and `list_by_thread()` hydrate historical runs from the store. In-memory records win for the same `run_id` so task, abort, and stream-control state stays attached to active local runs.
- `cancel()` and `create_or_reject(..., multitask_strategy="interrupt"|"rollback")` persist interrupted status through `RunStore.update_status()`, matching normal `set_status()` transitions.
- Store-only hydrated runs are readable history. If the current worker has no in-memory task/control state for that run, cancellation APIs can return 409 because this worker cannot stop the task.
- `POST /wait` (both thread-scoped and `/api/runs/wait`) drains the stream bridge via `wait_for_run_completion()` instead of bare `await record.task`, so it honours the run's `on_disconnect` setting and cancels the background run on real client disconnect rather than returning a stale checkpoint (issue #3265).
- Thread-scoped run creation accepts `checkpoint` / `checkpoint_id`; Gateway validates the checkpoint belongs to the request thread before writing `checkpoint_id` / `checkpoint_ns` into `config.configurable` for LangGraph branching.

Proxied through nginx: `/api/langgraph/*` → Gateway LangGraph-compatible runtime, all other `/api/*` → Gateway REST APIs.
